# My dotfiles
Setup scripts and config files for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

A lot of this is not automated right now, I honestly prefer doing a lot of it
manually and deciding what I do and don't want to install on a new machine.

## Configs
- `config/alacritty/` - Alacritty terminal config
- `config/i3/` - i3 window manager config
- `config/nvim/` - Neovim config
- `config/wezterm/` - WezTerm terminal config
- `config/omp/` - Oh My Posh theme
- `config/powershell/` - PowerShell profile
- `config/claude/` - Claude Code settings

Each config directory has `push-local-*` and `copy-local-*` scripts (.bat for Windows, .sh for Linux/Mac) to sync between this repo and your system.
